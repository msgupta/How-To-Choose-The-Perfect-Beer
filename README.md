# How-To-Choose-The-Perfect-Beer:

The data consists of various features that describe a beer. In many beer cellars, important factors such as temperature and humidity are maintained by a climate control system. Hence features like Cellar Temperature and Serving Temperature become really important. This is an actual data set that is curated over months of primary and secondary research. Each row contains fixed size object of features. There are nine features and each feature can be accessed by its name.

This dataset is from the competition: https://www.machinehack.com/course/how-to-choose-the-perfect-beer/
